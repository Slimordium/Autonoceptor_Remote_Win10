TF02 Lidar, Navspark NS-DR Dead-reckoning GPS and video is optionaly streamed to a remote PC using MQTT. Integrated with a SparkFun 16x2 LCD for debuging, and a XBox 360 controller for controlling and managing Waypoints.

There is a nuget package available for the MQTT Client here: https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=RxMQTT
